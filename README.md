1.    Suppose   that   a   young   couple   has   just   had   their   first   baby   girl,   Katie,   and   they   wish   to   ensure that   enough   money   will   be   available   to   pay   for   her   college   education. Currently, college tuition,   books,   fees,   and   other   costs,   average   $12,500   per   year.    On   average,   tuition   and   the   other   costs   have   historically   increased   at   a   rate   of 4%   per   year.
(a)   What   will   be   the   cost   of   the   first   year   of   college?    (Assuming   that   Katie   will   enter   college when   she   is   18.)
(b)    To   save   for   Katie’s   college   fund,   the   young   couple   decide   to   save   $3000   into   an   account   with   7%   interest   rate   on   every   Katie’s   birthday   since   her   first, what will   be the   amount   of   money   available   on   Katie’s   18th   birthday?
(c)    After   Katie   turns   18,   she   enters   a   four-year   college. The   couple   leave   the   above   college   fund   in   the   same   account   (paying   7% interest   rate),   making   no   further   deposits. Assum-   ing   that   college   costs   continue   to   increase   at   4%,   is   the   college   fund   enough   to   cover   all   four   years   of   Katie’s   undergraduate   education? Please   provide   numbers   to   support   your answer. (Hint: Assume that Katie needs to pay education cost at    the begining of each   period.)
